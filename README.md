## You can help us!

### Without programming

Simply find and [structure information](https://github.com/WeStrangers/Strangers/tree/development/src/assets) and [translate it](https://github.com/WeStrangers/Strangers/tree/development/src/locales) into your language.

### With programming

Just write code and make cool features! You can do it! We believe in it!

## Recommended Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur

- Use [vue-tsc](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/tree/master/packages/tsc) for performing the same type checking from the command line, or for generating d.ts files for SFCs.
